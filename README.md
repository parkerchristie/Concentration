# Concentration

Native iOS application of Concentration. The player tries to create matches of cards faced down. Scoring is based on making correct matches, or using a previously flipped card in an incorrect match (ex. if a card is flipped once, flipping it again without making a match with it will lose points). Multiple themes are cycled through upon starting a new game. Completed with assistance of Stanford Universityâ€™s online Swift course (https://itunes.apple.com/ca/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316) with independently added features such as theming and scoring.
